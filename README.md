Hello! This is the code I used to build an external Spring MVC website that uses Java Spring Boot for the backend and HTML/Bootstrap as the frontend. I used Spring Thymeleaf alongside an H2 in-memory database to be able to create a deletion/approval feature. This website is particularly for us to approve/decline requests and can be publicly visited using an AWS EC2 link.
